In Java, the main method is the entry point for a Java program. It is a special method 
that serves as the starting point for the execution of the program. When you run a 
Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the main method and begins executing 
the code inside it.

Here's the signature of the main method in Java:

public static void main(String[] args)

Let's break down this signature:

    public: The main method is declared as public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere 
    within the program.

    static: The main method is declared as static, which means it belongs to the class 
    itself rather than an instance of the class. This is necessary because the JVM needs 
    to be able to call the main method without creating an object of the class.

    void: The main method does not return any value. It is specified as void because it 
    doesn't produce a result.

    main: The name of the method is main.

    String[] args: The main method takes a single parameter, which is an array of strings 
    named args. This parameter allows you to pass command-line arguments to your Java program.

The main method is typically defined within a class. When the program starts, the JVM looks 
for a class that contains the main method and begins executing the code inside it.
